# Software-Engineering---Excel-Functions-in-c++
This project aims to use C++ to create an effective integer data analysing tool which mimics that of the functions Excel provides, experimenting with sorting algorithms. It will:
•	Analyse values and sort a given collection of integers inside a 2-dimensional array of integers in a specific given order,
•	Implement commands to calculate the mean, average, range and mode of given collections of data in the array,
•	And perform mathematical calculations that involve coefficients and constant quantities.
